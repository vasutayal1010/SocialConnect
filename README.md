<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is a fully functional User Interactive web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It enables users to connect, share content, and interact with each other in real-time through a modern, intuitive interface.

The application includes core social networking capabilities such as user authentication, content creation, dynamic user interaction, and private communication â€” all while maintaining a clean user experience. It also supports profile customization and real-time updates, making it both interactive and personalized.

This project demonstrates practical integration of full-stack technologies, state management, real-time communication, secure authentication, and responsive UI/UX principles
